=head1 NAME

MooseX::ClosedHash - blessed coderefs (closing over a hash) with Moose

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use v5.14;
   
   package Person {
      use MooseX::ClosedHash;
      has name => (is => "rw");
      has age  => (is => "rw");
      __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;
   }
   
   my $bob = Person->new(name => "Bob", age => 42);
   
   say $bob->name, " is ", $bob->age, " years old.";
   say $bob->dump;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<MooseX::ClosedHash> is a Moose module that lets you store your object's
attributes in a hash, closed over by a blessed coderef.

Why? I have no idea why you'd want to do this.

It provides a modicum of privacy I suppose. Privacy that is easily violated,
but that you're unlikely to accidentally violate.

=head1 BUGS
